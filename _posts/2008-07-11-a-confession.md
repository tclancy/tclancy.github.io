# A Confession

I bought <em>GTA IV</em>, played it for a week and then stopped. Some of it is <em>Rock Band</em>'s fault, but mainly the game doesn't do it for me anymore. <em>GTA III</em> was an amazing experience. <em>Vice City</em> was more of the same fun. By <em>San Andreas</em>, it just feels like work: go here, get this, do that, drive around. Even driving around looking for new stuff doesn't thrill me. I bought the most recent copy hoping all the glowing reviews reflected something new. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121460385251911957.html?mod=2_1168_1" target="_blank">Junot Diaz sums it up for the WSJ</a>:
<blockquote>GTA III was the tipping point: Everything else after was, no matter how awesome, just another better brighter, smoother version of the same . . . What else is the new GTA not? Well, despite all the critical adulation over GTA IV's characters and purported subtlety, this isn't a game that is nuanced or subtle.</blockquote>
If you like the article even just a tiny bit, I heartily recommend Diaz's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Brief-Wondrous-Life-Oscar-Wao/dp/1594483299/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1215779378&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><em>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</em></a>. And it's nice to think of the WSJ copyeditors having to ok the article's language as is.
