# A Brief Timeline of Last Night&#039;s Improbable Events

<ul>
	<li>3:05am - awakened by dog barking. Roll over.</li>
	<li>3:06 - Michelle gets up, saying something's not right as so many other dogs are barking</li>
	<li>3:06:20 - "Yeah, there's a cop talking to someone in our driveway. I think he's puking."</li>
	<li>3:07 - leave bed, descend stairs to front door</li>
	<li>3:07:01 - "Oop, he just ran away!"</li>
	<li>3:07:05 - Move to back door, watch cop's flashlight bounce through the backyard, stop at the mess of brush we really should have cleaned out last fall for easier passage of criminal activity</li>
	<li>3:07:55 - flashlight disappears</li>
	<li>3:10 through 4:00 - listen to dog left in K9 unit barking</li>
	<li>4:05 - K9 officer returns and drives off</li>
	<li>4:05:01 - fall asleep, immediately dream about a giant black dog with a flashlight at the back door demanding entrance</li>
	<li>4:06 - wrestle self awake</li>
	<li>rest of morning - dog insistent on cataloging every fooprint in the yard</li>
</ul>
