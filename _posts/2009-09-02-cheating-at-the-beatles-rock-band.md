# Cheating at The Beatles: Rock Band

My favorite thing about the game is the harmonizing and the way it increases the feeling that you're really in a band, but if you're all about the score (or bereft of friends), feel free to take advantage of these two pieces of information:
<ol>
	<li>The different singers do not have to sing different parts</li>
	<li>The multiple scores are based solely on having multiple microphones</li>
</ol>

In this case, 1 + 2 equals, "If you stick three microphones in front of your face and start wailing, you'll be credited as three singers, including the double and triple bonuses". Kids, you're only cheating yourselves.
