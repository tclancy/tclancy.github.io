# Humorless

I always take a peek at the people who add me on Twitter to see if it's someone I know, someone from the area (I'm interested to see how meatspace communities can spring up around virtual ones; <a href="http://twitter.com/hashtags" target="_blank">hashtags</a> is a great way to create brand-new communities on-the-fly*) or just a spambot. I just ignore the spam, life's too short to get fired up about it. But don't tell that to people who get added by <a href="http://twitter.com/BeerOfTheDay" target="_blank">BeerOfTheDay</a>:
<ul>
	<li>Â <a href="http://twitter.com/tarasis/statuses/788859307" target="_blank">"but beer looks and tastes awful. Give me wine, a mellow cider or a cocktail anytime. I'd rather pour beer down a drain."</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://twitter.com/bartvyvey/statuses/788691224" target="_blank">"Why are you following me? Clearly you don't know me. If you did then you should know I don't drink beer. Blocked!!!"</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://twitter.com/natalie/statuses/788660951" target="_blank">"seriously? you're following me? clearly you don't know me. block."</a></li>
</ul>
I can't decide if I like #2 or #3 better. #1 is standard Internet eltisim, but the other two seem to suggest a cognitive disconnect, like there was a fifteen second span after they opened the email where they thought, "I wonder who I know that joined Twitter and called himself BEER OF THE GODDAMN DAY." Hmm, Pete Coors? Nope, he's more of a mimeographed screed sort of guy. Adolphus Busch? Dead. Sam Adams? Fictional. It's a wonder anyone makes it out their door in the morning.
