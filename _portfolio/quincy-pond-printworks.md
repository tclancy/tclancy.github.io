_Helped Lightfin integrate a new site design with a Miva shopping cart._

<p>Quincy Pond Printworks came to Lightfin and I with two requirements: a beautiful-looking new site and a shopping cart. Lightfin took care of the first with their usual aplomb. There were only a few shopping carts we could pick from that worked with the client's bank, so we settled on <a href="http://www.mivamerchant.com/">Miva</a> and a web host that supported it. Like a lot of closed-source but extensible products, information about Miva is jealously guarded by the people who make a living selling extensions and books about the product, so customizing the software to meet the client's needs was a challenge. Where possible we bought inexpensive add-ons that gave us finer control over how products and navigation could be displayed. Where no add-on options existed, I dug in and learned how to make Miva Script do what was needed.</p>
