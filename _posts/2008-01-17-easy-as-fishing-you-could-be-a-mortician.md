# Easy as Fishing, You Could be a Mortician

Michelle is just putting the finishing touches on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gravediggers-Daughter-Joyce-Carol-Oates/dp/0061236829/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1200606834&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Joyce Carol Oates' <em>The GraveDigger's Daughter</em></a>, and I, for one, am ecstatic. The back-cover, the side that faces me when reading in bed unfortunately, features a large photo of the author's corpse, inexplicably standing upright while wearing a plum hat and OMIGOD SHE'S STILL ALIVE! Call the paramedics, stat! There's a pulse. Faint, but a pulse.
