# \"Rich Get Richer\": A Play in One Act

EXT - DAY: *An outdoor concert/ festival between acts. Our hero, TOM, just growing into his impossibly handsome looks in his late 30s strides purposefully toward Port-a-Potty Row. His path is interrupted by THE STRANGER, a younger man. Before TOM knows what is happening, he has been embraced in a full-arm handshake and pulled into a chest bump.*

STRANGER: ["Thanks for David Moyes!"](http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/17/david-moyes-manchester-united)

TOM [*realizing he is wearing an Everton jersey, smiles sheepishly and laughs*]

STRANGER: "Did you like that, didja? Saw you coming a mile away!"

TOM [*still laughing*]: "No, not really, no."
