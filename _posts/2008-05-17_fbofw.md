# FBoFW

There are a zillion stupid things I'm going to run into that make me realize how much I'll miss my mom (yesterday's twin headlines blared at me from the <a href="http://www.fosters.com/" target="_blank">Foster's</a> paper box: "Super Mom" and "Secrets for a Long Life"), but the thing that's got me right now is I've lost someone who enjoyed bitching about <em>For Better or For Worse</em> as much as I do. If she'd been more computer-literate, I'd have loved to send her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:For_Better_or_For_Worse" target="_blank">this</a>. I can't decide if it's horrifying or reassuring there are people willing to argue about the lives of a bunch of fictional Canadians.
