# Ground Energy: Ground Energy

## 2014-10-21

_Internet of Things project optimizing ground source heat pumps for homeowners and businesses_

<p>Built and currently maintain (and extend) the Django codebase that powers&nbsp;<a href="http://groundenergysupport.com/">Ground Energy</a>. The system receives status reports from geothermal installs once per minute, logs them to the database and provides both live reports and daily summaries. In spite of the enormous amount of data each installation generates, the site is able to return real-time reporting in a responsive manner.</p>
<p>In addition to speaking to our native installation devices which report by POSTing XML, I've abstracted the reporting to allow us to provide the same reports to owners of Ecobee thermostats by integrating with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ecobee.com/solutions/api/">their API</a>&nbsp;via OAuth requests.</p>
<p>Throughout the process I have worked directly with the principals to design and extend the services offered.</p><img src="/assets/portfolio/home_xBkDKn8.png" alt="Homepage " style="margin: 1em 0" />
