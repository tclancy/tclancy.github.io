<ul class="aktt_tweet_digest">
	<li>@rcade the KC Chiefs linebacker? Man, those AFC West rivalries run deep. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/901614255">#</a></li>
	<li>@ericwyman re: Gerrard, he must be pretty bad-ass if he's only missing 2 weeks after surgery to the groinal regions. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/901614957">#</a></li>
	<li>@CinemaSuicide I'm just going to assume you've heard "The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton". My favorite MG song (favorite album, too). <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/901657976">#</a></li>
	<li>@CinemaSuicide "All Hail West Texas" is my favorite from the 5 or 6 I have. Probably has my top 5 songs by them on it. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/901670527">#</a></li>
	<li>@chicobangs so I should watch on mute? Or I'm going to get 2 presidents for the price of 1? Thought we did that in '92. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/901750185">#</a></li>
	<li>'EEI lawyer ad spins it as DUI Defense in case your spouse gets bagged at 2am. Wrong target audience, pal. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/901870755">#</a></li>
	<li>Skill I don't possess: key ring updates <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/901876987">#</a></li>
	<li>@ericwyman Is Mark Kotsay the guy that airmailed a throw into the 1B stands from left in Fenway in the Pedro injury game way back when? <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/901880361">#</a></li>
	<li>@chicobangs Didn't you get an invite? We got together, watched some Foghorn Leghorn, pretended to care and left the crapper door open. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/901909265">#</a></li>
	<li>@chicobangs actually, I think you got blacklisted as a non-native. Sorry, but that's how Lyndon would have wanted to celebrate. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/901938105">#</a></li>
	<li>@ericwyman Ida Maria, old Josh Rouse, Hank Williams III. That's as close as I can get from my recent plays. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/901941154">#</a></li>
	<li>@ericwyman otherwise, I just go to this guy's last.fm profile: <a href="http://is.gd/1LJH" rel="nofollow">http://is.gd/1LJH</a> He's completely brilliant. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/901942650">#</a></li>
	<li>@mikesusz non-web savvy designers make you better at Photoshop when you have to learn to clean up their messes (cough @ericwyman) <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/901999999">#</a></li>
	<li>@suchatreat did you not see the part about "brilliant"? <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/902058124">#</a></li>
	<li>Tweaking my W3C  print tests. Thought I was pretty good with precise language until going through this. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/902118611">#</a></li>
