# Monty Back, Rommel Still Dead

Bob Montgomery is doing the color for today's Red Sox game and I can't figure out how to feel about it. Monty and the late Ned Martin were the voice of the Red Sox (on WSBK TV38) when I was growing up and it's strangely transporting to hear him again. He's done some Pawsox games, but it's hearing him back, like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097815/">Jake Taylor</a> (a fellow catcher) getting one last chance with the parent club. And it's like he's never left: same dulcet tones, knows the team, not a sign of age (unless you get a look at the tombstone of a gut he's developed in retirement).

It wasn't until about year 3 of the Don Orsillo Experience that I realized I'd seriously undervalued Sean McDonough. Orsillo is fine, but he's a generic Connecticut School of Broadcasting voice. Close your eyes and he could be talking about the Kansas City Royals. Sean McDonough's only sin for me (beyond the too-goofy adulation of Remy) was not being Ned Martin. Hearing Monty makes me feel like I'm ten, I've got a whole summer in front of me and there's nothing to worry about for the foreseeable future*. And that shit will get you killed.
