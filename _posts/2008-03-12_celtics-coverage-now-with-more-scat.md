# Celtics Coverage: Now with More Scat!

Tommy (re: injury reports): "Now I am told by the truck that good old Greg had the poop!"

Mike: "He did."

Tommy: "He had the poop! But he didn't give it to me!"

Mike: "He's got to share that stuff."

Tommy: "That's it!"

Tommy then sung the words "That is a mis-TAAAAKE" regarding the Sonics' defense of Paul Pierce. I'd like to take editorial license and claim Mike said, "He's gotta spread it around", but alas, it's not true.
