# There Are No New Stories

The ancient Greeks wrote them all. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/13/nyregion/13legal.html?hp" target="_blank">For example</a>:
<blockquote>"Mr. Spitzer’s suspicious financial transactions at North Fork <em>might never have been discovered were it not for a Suspicious Activity Report filed by HSBC</em> about the shell companies linked to Emperor’s Club V.I.P. in October, according to several people with knowledge of the inquiry, who spoke about the investigation on condition of anonymity.

<em>As it turned out, both the North Fork Bank and HSBC had faced inquiries into their lending practices led by Mr. Spitzer</em> when he was New York attorney general. In the case of North Fork, Mr. Spitzer announced a settlement in 2003 requiring it to refund more than $20,000 to dozens of homeowners and cease what he said was its practice of charging homeowners illegal fees."</blockquote>
Good thing you woke them up, Eliot.
