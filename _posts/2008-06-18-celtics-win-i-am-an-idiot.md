# Celtics Win + I Am An Idiot

But you knew that. One of the nice things about the Internet is the rise of what Charlie Stross calls the <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2007/05/shaping_the_future.html" target="_blank">"lifelog"</a>, a searchable list of everything you ever thought and did, a permanent Friend Feed. I mention this because I was so damned right about the <a href="http://www.sportsfilter.com/comments.cfm/8951" target="_blank">Celtics trade for Kevin Garnett</a>.
<blockquote>"Weird, I don't really like it from the Celtics' perspective . . . Can't see the Celtics signing anyone for about 10 years . . . I'm done with Danny Ainge. This off-season has made it clear the Celtics' interest is in competing for entertainment dollars, not championships."</blockquote>

Stunningly, this isn't the dumbest thing I've ever said on Sportsfilter. That would be this:
<blockquote>"Roberts has a .335 career OBP; he's a leadoff hitter like Tony Womack's a leadoff hitter. I'm not down on the guy before he's played an inning, but no one needs a pinch runner."</blockquote>
