# Who Wrox? This Guy Right Here

The main point of buying programming books from Wrox is the SI Swimsuit Issue-quality cover models. I'm calling a party foul on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-ASP-NET-2-0-Design-Programmer/dp/0470124482/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1203428335&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">this fellow</a>: note the casual, "Gosh, little ol' me?" pose that leads to a reveal of his skin art. If anything, you're scaring off your target audience, not attracting them.
