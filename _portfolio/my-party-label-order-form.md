# My Party Label: My Party Label Order Form

## 2010-02-13

_Turned manual email order process into an online form._

<p>Tired of accepting sometimes invalid orders over email, My Party Label came to me to create a form that contained all the information My Party Label needs to fulfill an order. The form allows users to send a good deal of custom information, but it makes sure they provide a basic set of information. If available, users can also upload a logo or design with the submission. Successful submissions are logged to a new database and open orders can then be retrieved as an Excel spreadsheet by site administrators.</p><img src="/assets/portfolio/my-party-label.jpg" alt="Order Form " style="margin: 1em 0" />
