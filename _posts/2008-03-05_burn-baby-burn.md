# Burn, Baby, Burn

Remember that movie where Clint Eastwood plays a fighter pilot? Yeah, me neither:

It even inspired a decent comment on YouTube:
<blockquote> . . . it's fun to pretend he's playing the same character as in Firefox. Why wouldn't they give the job of stealing a Soviet superplane to the man who won an air war against a giant spider?</blockquote>
