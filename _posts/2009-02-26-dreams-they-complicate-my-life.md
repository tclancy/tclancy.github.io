# Dreams They Complicate My Life

Had one of those constant dreams nights which I take as indicative of good sleep, though I was awoken by my iPod once. I've been listening to the over-my-head <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime.shtml">In Our Time</a> podcast because, whether it's terribly interesting or terribly boring, it makes me terribly sleepy. It was off-putting to wake up hearing a stranger in a dark room speaking of the Fall of Carthage. The highlights:

<ol>
	<li>Falls into what I would call the "Tetris Dream" category, when you've become a little <em>too</em> interested in something: had a dream where I was in a field hospital somewhere in the jungle watching a TV report, hosted by <a href="http://twitter.com/leolaporte">@leolaporte</a> about Canadian Twitterers, whom he referred to as "C-itters". I'd really hoped we were beyond that kind of prejudice in 2009.</li>
	<li>I was a amateur anti-mob sniper, recruited for the job by a rogue government agent who's ex-girlfriend I was dating (she was also recruited for the cause; for the record, I'm pretty sure it was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1330166/">this woman</a> from <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433309/fullcredits#cast">Numb3rs</a></em>). I was up in our hotel room[1] with my assignment in my sights when I noticed the Mob's snipers hanging out of the hotel window right next to me. Jumping back out of the window, I went to inventory the guns and ammunition I'd been left when the treachery became clear: the case had almost no bullets (but plenty AA batteries, the guns being electric). To heighten the stress of the moment, the cleaning crew started coming around the halls.</li>
	<li>To cap the evening, I got another go at my newest recurring dream. Since my Mom died, I've been having this strange cartographic dream where I try to map out the city of Newport[2] from a boat. It never works, the boat sinks and whatever I'm looking for goes unfound. I could probably save this dream-self a lot of time if he'd give me a whack at his map.</li>
</ol>

<small>[1] We'd gotten to the point in our relationship where we were not only comfortable sharing a hotel room, we could interrupt a vacation to gun down mobsters without any negative effect on our relationship
[2] More accurately, the whole of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquidneck_Island">Aquidneck Island</a>, as I think last time I wound up in Portsmouth under the Mount Hope Bridge.</small>
