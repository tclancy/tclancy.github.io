# Twitter Updates for 2008-10-02

<ul>
	<li>Squeeze this, ump&lt;/TawmyFromQuinzee&gt; <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/942752934">#</a></li>
	<li>be nice if Lester gets that strike zone in the bottom of the inning #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/942756909">#</a></li>
	<li>TBS' graphics and info packages are sub-NESN quality. Box score and pitch history are no where near as good. And Eck's tan looks weaker. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/942865067">#</a></li>
	<li>I know we're all excited about the Sox' newfound health, but can we at least consider s/Drew/Crisp, s/Lowell/Casey? <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/942866299">#</a></li>
	<li>@joshmillard Congrats. And yours is 2 years older than ours. I assume house problems is a logarithmic scale based on -years. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/942878135">#</a></li>
	<li>Get the feeling Vladdy couldn't score from 1st on a triple. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/942878515">#</a></li>
	<li>Upside to Lowell playing is he made a great play showing a target for Youk on Youk's great play. Youk &amp; Casey probably don't do that #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/942881459">#</a></li>
	<li>If Ellsbury restricts his Superman act to the playoffs, well, I'm ok with that. #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/942888518">#</a></li>
	<li>Angels fans, leaving in the top of the 9th = Curse of the Sham fan o. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/942889611">#</a></li>
	<li>Thought working for self meant sleeping in after playoff games. Stupid body/ stupid dog. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/943222413">#</a></li>
	<li>"I said *don't* use this as a photo!" <a href="http://is.gd/3qCD" rel="nofollow">http://is.gd/3qCD</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/943335997">#</a></li>
	<li>Pissed: sky opened up and I have to go rescue neighbor's dog and let him in + dog didn't really care to go in. Samaritan shit is getting old <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/943494206">#</a></li>
	<li>X-Cart, you're venturing into Intentionally Sucking territory: caching the wrong file as a template, injecting broken html *sometimes*. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/943599421">#</a></li>
