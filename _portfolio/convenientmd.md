# ConvenientMD: ConvenientMD

## 2013-05-21

_Built the website and tools that helped a startup grow to a major New Hampshire health provider_

<p>Worked directly with the founders to create the front- and back-end of their original web site and then extend it to add more tools as the business took off. Added online payment via the Authorize.net portal and a responsive design after the initial build. The site (and company) grew from one to nine locations during its lifetime.</p><img src="/assets/portfolio/home_V574hTu.png" alt="Homepage " />
