# No Dreamcatchers Either

You never see a good personalized plate on a hearse. Sure you'll see the occasional plate with the company name and a number, keeping you apprised of how many cars they have in their death fleet, but you never see something like "CU L8R". Just give me the driver's nickname or something. "FUZZY". I'd like that.
