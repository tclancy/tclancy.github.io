# Anxious

It doesn't bubble up to consciousness very often, but Christ I worry I'm forgetting something. Every day I'm going to forget the permission slip and have to slog through a phonics workbook while everyone else goes to the Museum of Science. It probably drives being anal retentive; if everything's put away, no way to miss what needs doing. I mention this because the driveway's threatening to wash away and there must have been a Saturday in June I could have prevented this but sat on the porch drinking beer instead.

To future self: continue to buy high-quality beer to justify this sort of thing.
