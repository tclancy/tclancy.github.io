# MarketConnector: Marketconnector Business Community

## 2009-04-27

_Social network for New England businesses built in PHP on Social Engine._

<p>It pains me enough, at almost 35, to see athletes my age retiring. So it was a shock to the system to have a client more than a decade my junior. <a href="http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20100419-BIZ-1010789">Ben Collins</a> is a business student at UNH studying to be an entrepreneur; this site is his head-start on the competition. Ben already had a business plan, a site design he created and a solid set of technology requirements. I worked with Ben to flesh out the requirements of the four sections he wanted and how to integrate them into the software package he'd chosen, <a href="http://www.socialengine.net/">Social Engine.</a></p>
<p>The site allows users to find jobs, post jobs, buy and sell items and get quotes for works from businesses in their local area. Set up as a social network, users can find trusted resources by getting recommendations in any of these categories from people they know.</p><img src="/assets/portfolio/MK_Homepage.png" alt="Homepage " />
