# Lone Watergunmen

I have a theory. A rather dangerous theory. I believe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_station" target="_blank">Numbers Stations</a> (the whole Yankee Hotel Foxtrot thing) are a blind to hide how governments really do secret communication. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Comics" target="_blank">Archie &amp; Jughead Double Digests</a> in the grocery store. Have you ever seen anyone buy those things? Anything else that doesn't sell by the truckload gets yanked from the impulse buy section in seconds.

I'm the only person I know who's picked them up; once to see if they had somehow improved so much over the inanity even my ten year-old self couldn't stand and the second time because the first time annoyed Michelle so well. The clerk didn't say anything either time, but those bitches are well-trained to maintain their mask of utter disinterest. A couple of flash mobs to clean out the stock at Shaws, and the world would be plunged into chaos.
