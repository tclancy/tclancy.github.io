# Popular with Jerks 25-40

Washing my high-horsepower, low-milage car as a break from my computer-based job while wearing Local Sports Team's baseball hat and streaming music made by white males (see below) from my Apple phone to a Bluetooth speaker, I thought to myself, "Boy, you need to step out of your demographic more often."

The bitch of it is I can't even have a couple of microbrews while contemplating how.

## An Aside Possibly Longer Than the Post

Reflecting on the music, [it is *really* white](http://www.last.fm/user/yerfatma/library). I don't think everything gets sent to Last.fm, but it's pretty representative and the first black artist is #25 on the list. There are plenty of black *guys*, but the one thing most of them have in common is they're dead. Fela Kuti, Bob Marley, a bunch of jazz guys from the '60s (and you can only just count them because it's oh-so demo perfect for a college-educated white guy to listen to old jazz). And there's a hell of a lot more black guys then there are women of any color. I think the only artist on my phone that might qualify is The Scissor Sisters and that feels like stretching a point. Time to start exploring again instead of sticking with what I know.
