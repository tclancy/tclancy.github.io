# Twitter Updates for 2008-10-16

<ul>
	<li>Stewing in my own gravy after nhupa-- loft at Pixel is still too hot. Brings back some memories. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/961497697">#</a></li>
	<li>Someone find this plumber and kill him. Not class warfare, just sick of the arguing from specific to general. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/961516556">#</a></li>
	<li>So McCain's Things He Wishes Hadn't Been Said were things about him, not by his supporters? Weird. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/961568859">#</a></li>
	<li>He's spending unprecented dollars and more than you because people  sent him more money. Wonder why. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/961578470">#</a></li>
	<li>Ironically, people on the autistic scale wouldn't be swayed by such cheap emotionalism. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/961619920">#</a></li>
	<li>Also: Voter Registration Fraud != Vote Fraud <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/961621049">#</a></li>
	<li>I have to admit I'm interested in McCain's "nuclear pants" concept. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/961628043">#</a></li>
	<li>I know Obama's up by a lot in the polls, but it'd be nice if he jumped some of this dumb shit. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/961629802">#</a></li>
	<li>I heard the first thing you see when you get off the plane in foreign countries is a clear explanation of smart econ policy. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/961645519">#</a></li>
	<li>Do you have any goddamn ideas or do you just know what Senator Obama wants/ doesn't want? <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/961648139">#</a></li>
	<li>Pretty sure Obama didn't oppose Stephen Breyer, who was appointed in 1994. By Clinton. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/961688315">#</a></li>
	<li>Not only does McCain have a record, he has a bunch of warped 78s. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/961740641">#</a></li>
	<li>@jlbruno Yeah, that's your marginal tax rate. What you want to keep an eye on is your effective tax rate. <a href="http://is.gd/4c0r" rel="nofollow">http://is.gd/4c0r</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/962564370">#</a></li>
	<li>Not sure I'm feeling Sylar as Spock. <a href="http://is.gd/4a2S" rel="nofollow">http://is.gd/4a2S</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/962579067">#</a></li>
	<li>Free SEO advice to restaurants: don't PDF your menu. It doesn't look that great anyway. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/962626808">#</a></li>
	<li>@CinemaSuicide When I need to focus and drown out distractions, I always fall back on Kid 606 or Shitmat. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/962627607">#</a></li>
	<li>"Joe the unlicensed, not a plumber" just didn't have the same ring. <a href="http://is.gd/4clI" rel="nofollow">http://is.gd/4clI</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/962695236">#</a></li>
	<li>@suchatreat "bald-faced". <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/962695627">#</a></li>
	<li>@serenemargarita only applies if you think "incentivize" is a word and not some bs marketing-speak. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/962736648">#</a></li>
	<li>@serenemargarita I don't disagree, but I feel your priority in that case is cutting the person's tongue out, not correcting grammar. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/962749503">#</a></li>
