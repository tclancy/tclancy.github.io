# Google Android Demo

Quick demo of Google's new operating system for phones, shot by someone from the Alice Clancy School of Cinematography (i.e., you will get motion sickness). With the exception of the compass mode at the end, there's nothing jaw-dropping. What is cool is how quickly the iPhone interface has gone from out-of-this-world amazing to an expected baseline of functionality (at least I'd like to think so, Sprint).
