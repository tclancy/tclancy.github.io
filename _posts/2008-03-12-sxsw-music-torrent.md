# SXSW Music Torrent

Literally. Somehow in the course of a year, the online music sampler from SXSW went from 60 songs to <a href="http://hewgill.com/sxsw/" target="_blank">48 hours of songs</a>, so I'd given up hope of finding anything new from this year's SXSW. Fortunately for me, <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/" target="_blank">Paul Ford</a> was willing to step in and act as a <a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/reviews/sixword_reviews_of_763_sxsw_mp3s.php" target="_blank">filter</a>. All via his <a href="http://twitter.com/ftrain" target="_blank">6-word limit Twitter feed</a>.
