# Twitter Updates for 2008-09-05

<ul>
	<li>@ericwyman yeah well, I'm coming back to work and then setting my house on fire to get a cut of that generosity. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/910101663">#</a></li>
	<li>hope Seinfeld is donating his time, because <a href="http://is.gd/2f3N" rel="nofollow">http://is.gd/2f3N</a> is painful <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/910610115">#</a></li>
	<li>Just bought 'Tommy' for to sate a flashback. No, not like that. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/910715108">#</a></li>
	<li>@dl004d The ghost of Dick Cavett is not impressed. No wait, he's just asleep. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/910748021">#</a></li>
	<li>@marcamos @AxsDeny also in the market for a new chair before my legs fall asleep permanently. Let me know what you find out. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/910749464">#</a></li>
	<li>@marcamos Where did you buy the chair? <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/910796857">#</a></li>
	<li>New UPS guy has the adngerous/sexy thing going awwwn. I gotta stop working at home. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/910846549">#</a></li>
	<li>TD Banknorth, if you're gonna charge $5 for a check image (which is a crime), at least send
									 electronically. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/910880783">#</a></li>
	<li>@chicobangs should have offered to caddy. Tell him you know these streets. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/910910617">#</a></li>
	<li>@therohmance I can't trust a firm that can afford to put those in The Economist weekly. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/910986552">#</a></li>
	<li>@therohmance I'll admit, it's a theoretical distrust and has yet to "impact their bottom line". <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/911000954">#</a></li>
	<li>Each week, a new headline that makes me feel less wimpy for not going to Yahoo! <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/911049871">#</a></li>
	<li>@circa1977 I prefer to think of being able to run Windows and Mac on one machine as "The Worst of Both Worlds". <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/911051169">#</a></li>
