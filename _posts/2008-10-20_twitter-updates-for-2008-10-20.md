# Twitter Updates for 2008-10-20

<ul>
	<li>Earplugs didn't prevent much. #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966768483">#</a></li>
	<li>Hate when home plate umps make a strike call on a close checked swing. Can't we get the 2nd opinion? #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966776385">#</a></li>
	<li>Found my enemy for the night: overly-demonstrative older woman, front row, just up the 3rd base line (over RH batter's shoulder) #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966784417">#</a></li>
	<li>McCain's ads make me feel like I missed an episode. Seem to have been edited with a blender. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966789099">#</a></li>
	<li>@ericwyman She's right above the New Era sign with a Petula Clark bob, between two old guys. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966797894">#</a></li>
	<li>Why would Varitek need to tell the catching coach what he's going to do? #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966800664">#</a></li>
	<li>@ericwyman good to hear. Make up for lost torrent time. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966801451">#</a></li>
	<li>Carl Crawford comes out to MIA? 1. Sounds anti-Amerikun to me. 2. Good luck signing a guy who's theme music says he just wants your money. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966802107">#</a></li>
	<li>@savetherobot Heart of Dorkness <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966807085">#</a></li>
	<li>Need to know what it says on Papi's non-standard, non-team issued shirt. Something dirty, no doubt. #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966814045">#</a></li>
	<li>Buck Martinez's Can't-catch-up-to-a-sliding-runner theory sounded like it was a new Law of Thermodynamics. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966850358">#</a></li>
	<li>Cialis, if your boner pills are so great, why do they require two soaking tubs? <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966850720">#</a></li>
	<li>@mikesusz I'd have thought the roof, Field Turf and different colored walls would have been a tip off. And the empty lounge chairs. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966852234">#</a></li>
	<li>Dunno, how big are 2 out hits? There are 0 outs right now. #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966867285">#</a></li>
	<li>@ericwyman looked like a Very Special Fan. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966867723">#</a></li>
	<li>TBS, you claim Frank Caliendo makes a big impression, I'd like to prove it. Have him meet me on top of the Sears Tower. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966868312">#</a></li>
	<li>"Hi, this is Matt Garza for Mucinex." <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966884242">#</a></li>
	<li>Anyone else catching a romantic subtext to Ron &amp; Buck's discussion of pitchers &amp; catchers? #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966884564">#</a></li>
	<li>@paulkelley the caught stealing? 3-2 and 1 out is a hit and run situation. Sucks they get the momentum from it. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966891559">#</a></li>
	<li>If that was an "easy" 1-2-3 inning, I don't want to see a hard one. Too much solid contact. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966894235">#</a></li>
	<li>@paulkelley yeah, it was definitely a risky move, but Tito seems to send the runner in that situation about 80% of the time. Sucked. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966898150">#</a></li>
	<li>PINCH HIT #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966904873">#</a></li>
	<li>Dog's snoring soundly. Don't know how she does it. Nerves of steel. #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966905651">#</a></li>
	<li>@ericwyman Thank you. Get that kid to an ENT, stat. #garzasnot <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966924348">#</a></li>
	<li>Someone in the front row order something to make those weird-ass munchkin waitresses go away #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966958859">#</a></li>
	<li>Now is that Animal or Hawk wearing the sweatshirt in the Tampa dugout? #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966959353">#</a></li>
	<li>@ericwyman How quick does Price go in our draft next year? <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966959687">#</a></li>
	<li>Ah well, great season, fun playoffs and Tampa's a damn good team. Could do without the fanbase. #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966972224">#</a></li>
	<li>What is that song? Where can I pay to have it not played? #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/966974276">#</a></li>
	<li>@CinemaSuicide Uf, thanks for giving me someone to block. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/967496360">#</a></li>
	<li>Please tell the dog I don't negotiate with terrorists. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/967764740">#</a></li>
	<li>Good post on the value of defense and the price of wins in MLB: <a href="http://is.gd/4qPK" rel="nofollow">http://is.gd/4qPK</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/967854690">#</a></li>
	<li>@adarowski @SoxyLady I was sorry to hear it too, but I think it's only "out of character" for the person he's portrayed as in the media. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/967855572">#</a></li>
