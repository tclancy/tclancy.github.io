# My Name is Crew

<p>I am posting this because I need to keep track of these things. Dreamt last night Michelle and I put on a community event centered around the retirement of some guy that had been a social worker all his life. After the dance crew came off the stage, there was a PowerPoint presentation of his life that I put together (each slide featured an allegorical photo of a raven) and a country music song. All I remember is:</p>
<p><em>My name is Crew<br />
My name is Crew<br />
Saving kids is kinda what I do
[a capella]Leading them away from a path of self-destruction . . .</em></p>

<p>And so on. The ravens were a result of watching a David Attenborough documentary last night and Michelle points out "kinda what I do" is a phrase that Bill Burr repeated in the stand-up show we watched <a href="http://www.thosecleverkids.com/blog/2009/01/10/anatomy-of-a-late-night/">again</a> last night. So that explains a bit of it, but I still don't get where these dreams with original music come from. I must be choking off my creative brain during waking hours. Earlier this week I'd dreamt <a href="http://raygun-o-gram.blogspot.com/" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;">my friend</a> had walked into a convenience store and declaimed a filthy sonnet in perfect ABAB rhyme scheme explaining why he needed to buy the <em>New York Times</em> Sunday Magazine and not the whole paper.</p>
