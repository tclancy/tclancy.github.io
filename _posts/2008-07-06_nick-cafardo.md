# Nick Cafardo

For a senior writer at the Globe, you sure manage to anchor the Bell Curve on the <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/articles/2008/07/06/he_says_hes_pitcher_of_health/?page=full" target="_blank">weekly notes columns</a>. Scattered amongst the feel-good crap about players he likes and the baseless trade rumors, he managed to throw in a testable hypothesis: "[Pat] Burrell <em>always has been overpaid</em> - he's making $14 million this season in the final year of his contract - but has hit at least 20 homers in each of the last eight years". Not sure what 20 homers means; it's a pretty context-free observation. Burrell's OPS+ and salary from 2005 to present:
<ul>
	<li>128, $7,250,000</li>
	<li>122, $9,750,000</li>
	<li>127, $13,250,000</li>
	<li>155, $14,250,000</li>
</ul>
So he's been 20% better than league average (admittedly, that includes hitters at all positions, which is a bit deceptive, especially in the NL) and is now 50% better than average and he's "overpaid". I think there are better ways to spend $14 million in MLB salary money, but it's the last year of a back-loaded contract. Burrell doesn't quite make the top <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/salaries/top25.aspx?year=2008" target="_blank">25 salaries for 2008</a> and, looking at that list, there are worse ways to be spending that money. I don't remember what Burrell's misdeed was that made him a Bad Guy for out-of-town sportswriters, but I think the Globe could find better uses for their ink budget. Cafardo's always been overpaid.
