# The AV Club

has replaced deadspin as the one place where I read the comments. The first 100 or so in the earth-shatteringly important <a href="http://www.avclub.com/content/dvds/square_pegs_the_like_totally" target="_blank"><em>Square Pegs</em></a> review are terrific. I'm guessing it's as much a function of being close in age to the majority of the posters as it is any great coming together of Internet humorists. I'm basing that assumption on scant evidence: the number of people who remember an 80s show and the fact one of the posters has a nick based on a MC Paul Barman line. Speaking of MPB, he has <a href="http://www.mcpaulbarman.com/" target="_blank">new tracks out</a> but they didn't do it for me on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/mcpaulbarman" target="_blank">first listen</a>. Don't take my word for it though; I tend to immediately stop listening whenever someone on the 'net starts a foreskin debate.
