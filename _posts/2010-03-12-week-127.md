# Week 127

(idea cribbed from <a href="http://berglondon.com/blog/" target="_blank">BERG</a>, week count done by <a title="It only works if you're reading it this week, duh." href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=weeks+since+10/1/2007">Wolfram Alpha</a> because I am too lazy)

<em>"[T]he beauty of reading a page of de Selby is that it leads one inescapably to the happy conclusion that one is not, of all nincompoops, the greatest."</em>
<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Policeman">The Third Policeman</a>*</em>

Mix of a week. Started with some edits to the XML parser I wrote for Financial Institution Client as part of a project that decrypts (GPG) a large set of XML documents, skims them for the parts we're interested in, dumps the relevant bit into an Expression Engine database and then transforms all that via XSL to display a customizable dashboard (jQuery UI) on the front end. How's that for a keyword-rich blog post? Tangentially speaking, this week reminded me that of all the languages, technologies, whatever you like that I work in, XSL is probably the easiest one to make a great mess in. It looks just like XML and HTML, how hard could it be? A little bit of XPath knowledge and you're good to go. To make a complete mess. When you write an infinite loop in a normal language, it's pretty obvious: you sit there a while, the computer starts to get noisy, the lights go dim. After a few dozen times, you realize what you've done. XSL is (like) a functional programming language. And with all that recursion, it's easy to make a computer do something Big Number of times. Just harder to spot.

Also did some final-mile edits on a social network application from <a href="http://slimkiwi.com/">Slim Kiwi</a> built on top of <a href="http://pinaxproject.com/">Pinax</a> (and Django).  Hoping it's truly "final-mile" as the project is really cool and I'm quite proud of it. There's a ton of geolocation and mapping going on and a fair number of other bright things happening (the bright ideas being supplied by other team members and the bright implementation by Django, obviously).  I was able to roll some of the geo search and Google Maps integration right into a site for <a href="https://www.ctbonline.com/pages/home">Community Trust Bank</a>, a project from <a href="http://www.lightfin.com/">Lightfin Studios</a> (you can see the location stuff at the <a href="https://www.ctbonline.com/pages/locations">branch &amp; ATM finder</a>). That's the second bank site I've built with Lightfin, the other being the much-closer-to-home (but harder to spell) <a href="http://www.piscataqua.com/index.aspx">Piscataqua Bank</a> (built in .NET) which got some updates this week as well.

At the end of last week I started to ramp up on my second Django site with Lightfin. Not much to say about it yet except that it integrates with a third-party API which reminds me of one thing: I hate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a> (the overly-verbose web service format, not the cleaning product so beloved by my ancestors they enslaved a leprechaun to endorse it). Please don't ever use it. I'd rather parse faxes by hand. If you're stuck dealing with SOAP in Python, <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/suds/">Suds</a> seems to be the best parsing package out there. I'm sure there was other stuff going on, but the only thing I can think of is some cleanup I did of an old ASP site and the less said, the better.
