# Twitter Updates for 2008-09-11

<ul>
	<li>Dear Customer, getting huffy and telling me something "must be resolved" when the problem is your shitty host = not helpful <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/917552650">#</a></li>
	<li>@CinemaSuicide I read two of the books and came away with the impression the screenwriter for "Fletch" did a hell of a job. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/917577216">#</a></li>
	<li>@ericwyman @ufex iTunes 8 seems to have fixed iPod scrobbling issues with last.fm. My spell-checker thinks that sentence sux. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/917622927">#</a></li>
	<li>Blanche de Chambly cases at Gary's, but $45 feels like a lot for rent on a case of beer. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/917798923">#</a></li>
	<li>@CinemaSuicide is the Sunday date for reals? And why Sunday? <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/917860233">#</a></li>
	<li>Used button on front of the scanner for first time today. Monitors went to sleep at the exact same second. Shat pants. Figuratively, I think <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/917878286">#</a></li>
	<li>@CinemaSuicide thinking about new drums. Mine are about dead. I was excited for the Ion kit, but no brain box = not a real drum kit. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/917896829">#</a></li>
	<li>@lotd that's Randy Newman, not 3 Dog Night. COME ON! <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/917911372">#</a></li>
</ul>
