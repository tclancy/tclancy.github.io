# Twitter Updates for 2008-10-15

<ul>
	<li>If fruit flies didn't exist, DNA scientists would have to invent them. And then we'd have to kill the scientists for making something evil. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/959856343">#</a></li>
	<li>@paulkelley I love The Mayor as much as the next guy, but Casey has 14 XBHs in 199 at bats this year, all of them doubles. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/959857457">#</a></li>
	<li>Can we get Carlos Pena back? Or at least have his Mass state residence revoked? #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/959864088">#</a></li>
	<li>Uf. #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/959864442">#</a></li>
	<li>Got out of the inning with only 3 runs scored. Improving! #redsox <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/959872075">#</a></li>
	<li>It's getting to the point where the FrankTV ads are the least painful part. #redsox No, no it's not. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/959872545">#</a></li>
	<li>@paulkelley Even hurt, Ortiz was 25% better than Casey this year. A small sample of playoff ABs doesn't change that. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/959874031">#</a></li>
	<li>Buck's even got Ron Darling saying "David ORtiz". Weird. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/959879245">#</a></li>
	<li>I can take the losing, it's the complete lack of response that's killing me. #redsox Also, Manny Delcarmen's stuff &gt; his results. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/959979690">#</a></li>
	<li>Listening to a terrific concert by Blind Pilot - <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3zay22" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/3zay22</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/960570493">#</a></li>
	<li>Remind me to never use thickbox ever again. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/960611970">#</a></li>
	<li>@boonyboy Hoo. I wouldn't say I'm okay; can't you see the grimace? <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/960653241">#</a></li>
	<li>Client refuses to grasp all these interface issues he sees are a combo of his narrow design + his old person font size settings in IE6. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/960654421">#</a></li>
	<li>@ericwyman sounded like he was going to miss it. Don't worry baby, I'll be there. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/960716333">#</a></li>
	<li>Waiting for an iTunes 8 update that unscrews Airtunes issues. Oh, and makes the progress bar work again. Genius. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/960726153">#</a></li>
	<li>@jeremydurham OCaml. Your move. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/960753521">#</a></li>
	<li>There is a guy on the AV Club who goes by "Black Bolt" all his comments say "...". <a href="http://is.gd/48vQ" rel="nofollow">http://is.gd/48vQ</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/961155426">#</a></li>
