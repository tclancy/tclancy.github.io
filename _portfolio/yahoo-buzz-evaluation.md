# Yahoo!: Yahoo! Buzz Evaluation

## 2007-09-18

_Reviewed the beta version of Yahoo! Buzz to evaluate the possibility of building widgets for it._

<p>Sort of a strange engagement in one of my first freelance jobs. At the time, Yahoo was marching forward so quickly on so many things they didn't have resources to build everything they were working on. They asked Revenution to look at the brand-new Buzz tool to evaluate the possibility of building a number of widgets for it. Given the list of widgets they wanted, Yahoo asked for an evaluation of Buzz focusing on whether we would be able to do things via screen-scraping or if they would need to provide an API.&nbsp;</p>
