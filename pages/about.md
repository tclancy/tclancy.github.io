# About Me

Hi, I'm Tom, a developer from Dover, NH. I've been involved in every part of the application development process for two decades, taking projects from sketches to UI to requirements to deployed code. What still excites me is working with people to create solutions that make things better.

A resume-like intro for the more bot-minded: Seasoned technology consultant with over two decades of experience spanning the application development lifecycle. I transform concepts from initial sketches to deployed solutions, specializing in performance  optimization, system architecture, and team leadership. What continues to drive me is collaborating with people  to build solutions that make meaningful change.
