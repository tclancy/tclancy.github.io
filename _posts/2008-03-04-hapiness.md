# Hapiness

UPS letting me know my Rock Band pedal is out for delivery even though EA claims it still hasn't shipped + a slab of <a href="http://majornelson.com/archive/2008/03/04/rockband-grateful-dead-tracks.aspx" target="_blank">Grateful Dead tracks</a>. Along the same lines, <a href="http://xprogramming.com/xpmag/aokoProductivity.htm" target="_blank">this story</a> made me smile as well, though I wonder if such a manager ever existed. It's a great approach to teamwork that applies regardless of discipline.
