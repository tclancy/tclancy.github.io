# It's My Party (now)

I'm trying really hard to take parenting magazines seriously, but they seem to be written for a demographic that straddles dense and insecure. The latest unsolicited offering from *Parents*&mdash;

is apparently for people who don't already know ice cream cake and enough room to run around tests really well with kids age 0 to 5. I suppose I *could* spend a bunch of money and time on an incredibly indulgent party for Josie to feel superior to other parents, but wouldn't it be so much simpler and cheaper to ruin the other kids' parties? Weeks of planning and a few hundred bucks versus a few afternoons of distracting jugglers, arguing with clowns and playing "leave a tail for the donkey". No choice at all.
