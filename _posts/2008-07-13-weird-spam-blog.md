# Weird Spam Blog

I'll admit to Googling around when doing NYT crosswords when something tickles my head. Today I was trying to remember the spelling of the sequel to <em>Shogun</em> (I was way off; only had the T right). The top Google hit for "shogun sequel" is currently <a href="http://ivahmore09.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!B06372C6B8C9D3ED!119.entry" target="_blank">this blog post</a>, which has the text of a bunch of today's crossword clues in it. Clicking on the video got me an ActiveX error on a Mac, but the page tried to force a .dmg download. Class.
