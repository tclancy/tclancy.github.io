# Twitter Updates for 2008-10-08

<ul>
	<li>if you're gonna "Hack the DEBATE!!!" on #current, maybe double-check spelling and yo gramma. <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/950453716">#</a></li>
	<li>My friends, McCain must have spent all his debate prep on that mic-hand-swap punctuation move #debate08 <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/950652225">#</a></li>
	<li>Also, does McCain think he's running for King of Sparta? Glory, respect, victory, etc. Fuck a concept. #debate08 <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/950654168">#</a></li>
	<li>Wait, we knocked the Russians out of Afghanistan with a little help? And the Taliban was there before the Russians? #debate08 <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/950664103">#</a></li>
	<li>Worst joke ever, grampa. What was the punchline? #debate08 <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/950670588">#</a></li>
	<li>Just so I'm clear: McCain's father was the admiral in charge of US gov't bowel movements? #debate08 <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/950720234">#</a></li>
	<li>If The Wire were still on, what would be the brand name drug right now? "High Risk", "Bailout"? "Credit Default Swap" is too much a mouthful <a href="http://twitter.com/tclancy/statuses/951559974">#</a></li>
</ul>
