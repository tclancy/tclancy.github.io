# Dearest Gmail,

If you continue to swallow important information from clients inside your fancy "- Show Quoted Text -" block, we aren't going to be friends much longer. I love how you overcome my scatterbrained nature, but when you cost me money that means I can pay for something else to watch over my shoulder.
