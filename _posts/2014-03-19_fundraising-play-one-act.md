# Fundraising: A Play in One Act

**INT - NIGHT - a fundraiser from University of Rochester calls TOM who has the phone on speaker while holding JOSIE. We join the call in progress . . .**

* Caller: "Sir, no amount is too small."
* Tom: "Well, I make like ten cents a day punching out plates. How about a cent a week?"
* Caller: "One cent?"
* Tom: "Yeah."
* Caller: "Does this organization match donations?"
* Tom: "I dunno. HEY SCREW! Do you guys do matching donations? . . . Whoa. Whoa! WHOA!"
* Tom: "No, it's going to just be the one cent."
* Caller: "Is there a better number to reach you at?"
* Tom: "Well, I got a cell phone in the toilet, but I don't want to give that out."
