# No More of That Then

As part of my personal Moratorium Project, I'm asking all respected, older male authors to immediately cease publication of erotic passages in their works. Future Mailers, I can't have it, you greying literary lions with pot bellies and your remaining hair in the wrong places, striding about the literary world like old guys in the gym bathroom, too pleased in their nakedness, writing things like:

I am a great spurting tower. My manhood:
a white derrick sunk deep in the folds of Mother Earth by prospectors (who plumbed her depths well and took her secrets)

No one wants to see it, so close the kimono, gramps.
