# Worst Pickup Line: A Play in One Act

INT - BEER STORE - DAY

CREEPY GUY, a man in his late 50s in hiking shorts and an ankle brace is paying for a popsicle at a beer store at 10:30 in the morning with the change from what is either a prescription pill container or a film canister. He holds the canister out so the cashier can return his change without touching him

CREEPY GUY: You still married to the guy who owns this place?

CASHIER: Yeah

CREEPY GUY: He treating you alright?

CASHIER [_moves to closed register with a pile of newspapers on it_]: I can take you over here sir.
