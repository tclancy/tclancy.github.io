# Heard on the Internet Today

<a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/18.54887#397403" target="_blank">"<span id="intelliTXT">Ah, autism. I miss the days of Sparta, where kids like that would be left on a mountain until something comes along and eats them. Now we have to take care of the droolers instead."</span></a>

Congrats on living so long in spite of your winning personality. Of course, why I was expecting a higher level of discourse on a video game board is even more confusing than how someone in 2008 AD misses ancient Sparta.
