# That Was Quick

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0907657/" target="_blank">Once</a> wins <a href="http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003714808" target="_blank">Best Original Song</a> at the Oscars last night (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzQRuTwaFI8" target="_blank">here's the song in the movie</a>) and today the soundtrack is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/music/ref=pd_dp_ts_m_1" target="_blank">best <em>overall</em> selling album at Amazon.</a> Cool. I still wish he didn't always go to the falsetto when he needed something extra.
